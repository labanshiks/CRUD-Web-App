# CRUD-Web-App with Python and Flask

In this project, I built a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) employee management web app using Flask, a microframework for Python. It has the following features:

Users will be able to register and login as employees
The administrator will be able to create, update, and delete departments and roles
The administrator will be able to assign employees to a department and assign them roles
The administrator will be able to view all employees and their details
